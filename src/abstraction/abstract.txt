 Abstraction means - A process of hiding the implementation details 
 and showing only functionality to the user.
 
 example : sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. 
 You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.

 It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. 
 It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.
